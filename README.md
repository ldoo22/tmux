# Custom tmux Config File

This repository contains my custom tmux configuration file. Feel free to use it for your own tmux setup.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ldoo22/tmux.git ~/.config/
```

## Setup

Once you have cloned the repository, you'll need to install the plugins. Launch tmux and use the following keybinding:

```
prefix + i
```

The `prefix` key is usually set to `Ctrl + b` by default. So, to install the plugins, press `Ctrl + b` first, then release it and press `i`.

With the plugins installed, your custom tmux configuration should be up and running.

Enjoy your personalized tmux setup! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
